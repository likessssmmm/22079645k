The side lines on both sides of the body need to be trimmed with scissors to make the side lines look more natural. In addition, the limbs need to be cut into a proportionate cylindrical shape, while the head, eye brows and moustache need to focus on line and length. This short-haired look of the dog is very suitable for owners who love to dress up and take it to different occasions where it can wear different types of clothing and look very sweet and malleable.
