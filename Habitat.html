    	<p><li>The Standard Schnauzer has a very high IQ, is full of intelligence, has excellent judgement and is very energetic. Happy to be trained, courageous, with great endurance and resistance to weather and disease. It is agreeable by nature, has an alert expression, is very gallant and extremely loyal. It is a gentle companion dog and usually gets along well with children.</p></li>
   	<p><li>The Schnauzer is a unique breed that can be as calm and elegant as a poodle or as energetic as a terrier. The Schnauzer is friendly to all familiar people, but when it comes to unwarranted provocation, it will fight back without fear or favour, even though it may be smaller than the other dog.</p></li>
	<p><li>The advantages of the Schnauzer are that it does not shed and is relatively intelligent. The disadvantages are that they are more active and their fur needs to be trimmed regularly, with special attention paid to the fur around their mouths which can easily get dirty, and that the ears of the Snowy need to be cleaned often as there is a lot of ear hair which is prone to ear mites or inflammation if not cleaned.</p></li>

 <h2>Feeding Methods</h2>
 	<p>Schnauzers have a high demand for food, with high protein, high fat, easy to digest food, feeding once in the morning and once in the evening, and make sure to supply enough clean water, which is more important in summer, otherwise it is easy to get heatstroke.</p>	
	<p>In the ordinary course of feeding, we should always pay attention to the mental state, action, appetite, stool form, dryness and humidity of the nose pad and the degree of coolness and heat of the nose pad, to keep abreast of the dog's health status, and if you find abnormalities or signs of disease, you should take early treatment measures.</p>
	<p>The yellowing of the whiskers in Schnauzers has not been found to have a specific cause, but it may be caused by frequent drooling, wrong drinking habits and regular consumption of food with high humidity. To try to avoid yellowing of the whiskers, it is recommended to use a water fountain for water and try to consume dry dog food.</p>
	<p>In the daily feed for Schnauzers, there should be 250g to 350g of meat, plus an equal amount of cooked dry veg or biscuits. Meat should be cooked, chopped, added with the right amount of water, and mixed with cooked dry ingredients before feeding. Feeding should be timed and limited to end within 15-25 minutes. If the food is not finished within the specified time, the trough should be removed and cleaned.</p>
